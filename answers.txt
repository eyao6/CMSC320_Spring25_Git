Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: In a data science class, we might use Git to version control our code and collaborate efficiently on projects, 
        ensuring that changes are tracked, experiments are reproducible, and team members can work simultaneously without conflicts.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Tech Consulting

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines branches by creating a merge commit, preserving the full history, and is ideal for collaborative workflows. 
        Rebasing replays commits onto another branch, creating a linear history, and is best for private branches or cleaner histories, 
        but it rewrites history and should be used cautiously on shared branches.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Playing pickleball and going to Spring Formal.
